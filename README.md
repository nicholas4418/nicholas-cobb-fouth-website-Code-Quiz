# Fourth Website: Web APIs - Code Quiz

## Description

- The motivation behind this project was to create a website from scratch that would contain a coding quiz.
- I worked on this project as a means to further familiarize myself with HTML, CSS, and Javascript as well as to introduce me to an example of a typical coding assessment.
- The problem this project solves is that I still lack experience with the fundamental languages used in web development, specifically Javascript.
- Through this assignment, I have reinforced the importance of using Javascript and how it can drastically improve a website's usability and functionality.

## Installation 
- N/A

## Usage
- This project can be used as another, more thorough refresher on what proper vanilla Javascript implementation looks, as well as guide on HTML and CSS usage.
- This project can also serve as a simple and quick example of what part of a typical coding assessement might look like.
